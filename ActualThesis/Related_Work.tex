Many papers have been published in the domain of using deep learning for medical image analysis. This has been spurred in part due to large carefully curated labelled datasets which have led to papers showing expert-level performance on many medical image classification tasks \cite{irvin2019chexpert}. In this section we will review work related to the thesis title.
